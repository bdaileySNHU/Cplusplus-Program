The client for this project is a company called The Gaming Room. They were not familiar with setting up a project in a web-based environment for their game Draw It or Lose It. Draw It or Lose It is a game of 4 rounds where a drawing is rendered over 30 seconds and a team has to guess the puzzle over a total of 1 minute. The Gaming Room wanted to expand their came to include a web based version of their gaming app. 

I think I did a good job with the requirements and design constraints portion of the design document. I feel like I covered all the major variables in a way that was easy for someone non technical to understand. If I could chose a section of the document to revise I would say the evaluation and recommendations could have been fleshed out a little bit more.

It is important to consider the user's needs from the beginning. Decisions made at the beginning like what kind of languages and technologies the project will use are not easy decisions to change down the line. These decisions could end up having a big impact on the user and if not considered from the beginning you could end up wasting a lot of time, energy, and resources just to start over with a different technology.
